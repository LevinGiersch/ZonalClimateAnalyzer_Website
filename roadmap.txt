# ROADMAP:


# 1.
# when using a shapefile with multiple features, the output of lokal_climate_analysis() has severals rasterstats dicts as values but it is not clear to which feature each rasterstat dict belongs.
# -> find a way to include the information about the feature of the shapefile the rasterstats calculation is performed on
# -> all in one big dict? split the shapefile into its features and perform lokal_climate_analysis() on each feature isolated?

# 3. 
# find a good way to add the rasterstats to the shapefile so i can have a nice interactive geopandas map and when i click on the shapefile it gives me all the relevant information from the raster calculations.

#4 
# in the end run latex file automatically by typing "pdflatex 'filename'" in the terminal\
